# Python implementation of the OpenAI Realtime Assistant API

The current OpenAI doc is in React, waiting for python implementation, here is a python implementation of the OpenAI Realtime Assistant API (No longer used because llamaindex implemented a nice python app).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
Here we go, you can talk with the assistant. 

## Todo 

My code isn't optimal (the doc isn't very clear and I am trying to grasp all the audio stuff). 
Additionnaly, the price is quite high, and I think openai will release the python implementation soon.
This said, I may work on two other things for this repo: 

- [ ] Add Web UI
- [ ] Add a simple RAG tool because it seems cool
